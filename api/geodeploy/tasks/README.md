# api/geodeploy/tasks/

## Purpose
Celery background workers that run the upload → ready pipelines so HTTP requests return immediately and the UI polls job status.

## Contents
- `vector_ingest.py` — `ingest_vector(job_id, layer_id, file_path, layer_name, schema_name, table_name)`:
  **COPY-based** (`_ingest_via_copy`): stream Fiona features → temp CSV (attributes + geometry as **WKB
  hex**) → `COPY` into an UNLOGGED staging `geometry` column → one `INSERT…SELECT` that **reprojects in
  PostGIS** (`ST_Transform`, using the source EPSG; client-side pyproj only as a fallback when the EPSG
  is unknown) into the final `geometry(Geometry,4326)` table → GiST index → `ST_Extent` bbox. Streams from
  disk (no in-memory feature list), bulk-loads, set-based reprojection — fast on large files. Int columns
  use `BIGINT`. Updates `upload_jobs`/`vector_layers` via **raw sqlite3** (runs in the Celery process).
- `raster_ingest.py` — `ingest_raster(job_id, layer_id, file_path, s3_key)`:
  inspect (rasterio) → COG-convert if needed (`services.cog_converter`) → upload to MinIO (boto3) → save metadata (crs, bbox, band_count, nodata). Same raw-sqlite3 status updates. Reads storage creds from the `setup_config` table first, falling back to settings.
- `csv_import.py` — `import_csv(job_id, layer_id, source, schema, table, x_col, y_col, srid, is_s3)`:
  builds a PostGIS point layer from a CSV's X/Y columns. **COPY-based** (`_load_copy`): the CSV (a temp
  file — downloaded from S3 when `is_s3`, or the uploaded local file otherwise) is `COPY`d into an UNLOGGED
  staging table, each column's type is inferred **in SQL** (regex over the staged text → `bigint`/`double
  precision`/`date`/`text`; leading-zero ints stay text, ISO dates only, 18-digit int cap), then a single
  `INSERT…SELECT` with **guarded casts** (a bad cell → NULL, never aborts) + `ST_MakePoint`→`ST_Transform`
  4326 fills the final table; GiST index; staging dropped; temp file removed. Streams from disk, so no
  in-memory row cap. **All** CSV columns are kept (X/Y stay as attributes too). Dispatched from
  `routers/data/discover.py` (import existing) and `routers/data/vector.py::upload-csv` (upload). The
  `delimiter` is user-chosen (comma default; comma/semicolon/tab/pipe — auto-sniffing is unreliable),
  threaded into both the header read and the `COPY … DELIMITER`. Reuses `vector_ingest`'s sqlite helpers.
- `geoparquet_import.py` — `import_geoparquet(job_id, layer_id, s3_key)`: registers a **GeoParquet**
  vector layer. Unlike CSV/shapefile (copied/ingested into PostGIS), the file STAYS on object storage
  and is read in place by DuckDB/deck.gl — so this task touches **neither PostGIS nor Martin**. The
  object is already present (the browser PUTs it direct via a presigned URL; or it's an import-existing
  attach), so the task `duckdb_engine.inspect_parquet`s it (geometry type / bbox→4326 / columns /
  CRS / count), saves metadata with `status='processing'`, then **chains
  `geoparquet_prep.prepare_geoparquet`** (which marks the layer + job ready when the spatial prep
  finishes). Storage creds from SQLite (§0f). Sets `storage_backend='geoparquet'` + `s3_key`. No longer
  auto-tiles to PMTiles (display is moving to deck.gl over the prepared GeoParquet — see `geoparquet_prep`).
- `geoparquet_prep.py` — `prepare_geoparquet(layer_id, s3_key, job_id=None)`: rewrites the GeoParquet
  **Z-order-sorted (Morton) by bbox centre with a GeoParquet 1.1 `bbox` covering column**
  (`duckdb_engine.sort_with_covering`) so DuckDB prunes row-groups on a bbox filter — fast analysis AND
  the deck.gl viewport feed (`query_features_geojson`). The file STAYS GeoParquet (no PostGIS, no
  PMTiles); **overwrites the object in place** (`out_key==s3_key`) so the catalog key is stable and
  re-running is idempotent. Then re-inspects (the covering column is dropped from catalog columns) and
  marks layer + job ready. Chained from `geoparquet_import` (auto on upload) and triggerable via
  `POST /data/vector/{id}/prepare`. Requires `pyarrow` (vectorised arrow UDFs); creds from SQLite (§0f).
- `pmtiles_tile.py` — `tile_geoparquet(layer_id, s3_key, pmtiles_key)`: the GeoParquet **display** path.
  Runs **tippecanoe** (built into the image, `/dev/stdin`, `-l geodeploy`, **`-z12` capped max zoom**
  `--coalesce-densest-as-needed --simplification 10`) fed by a thread streaming `duckdb_engine.stream_geojsonseq` (GeoParquet →
  GeoJSONSeq, no giant temp file), uploads the `.pmtiles` to storage, sets `pmtiles_key`/`tile_status`. The
  browser streams the tiles via range requests (no per-pan server work). Chained from `geoparquet_import` after
  inspect (auto-tile on upload); also triggerable via `POST /data/vector/{id}/tile`. DuckDB keeps reading the
  original `.parquet` for analysis/download — the `.pmtiles` is display-only.
  **Progress logging (2026-06-08):** the task captures tippecanoe's stderr progress bar (it uses `\r`, which
  never newline-flushes to `docker logs` — read byte-wise, split on `\r`/`\n`, re-logged as `tippecanoe: …`)
  and logs start / stream feature-count / total elapsed; `stream_geojsonseq` logs periodic feature throughput.
  So `docker compose logs -f celery` now shows live tiling progress (the stream's feature counter is the real
  signal — tippecanoe stays silent while blocked on stdin during the slow shapely-conversion phase).
- `export.py` — `export_bundle(bbox, items)`: clips the chosen portal layers to a bbox and writes a
  ZIP to `data/temp/exports/{task_id}.zip` (served by the API's `export-download`). Vector via
  psycopg2 (GeoJSON/CSV) + `ogr2ogr` (GeoPackage); raster via rasterio windowed read with an output
  cap (`MAX_PIXELS`, downsamples huge selections via overviews). Offloads the heavy clip off the API
  process. Routed to the `ingest` queue (the only one the worker consumes). **Writes to `{id}.zip.part`
  then `os.replace()`** to the final name — see known issues for why.
- `__init__.py` — package marker.

## Dependencies / relationships
- Registered in `celery_app.py` (`include=[...]`), routed to the `ingest` queue.
- `vector_ingest` calls `services.martin.regenerate_config` (so a successful upload makes the layer immediately tileable).
- `raster_ingest` calls `services.cog_converter` and writes to MinIO; TiTiler reads the COG straight from MinIO at tile time (no registration step needed).
- Both write to the same SQLite DB the API reads (`{data_dir}/sqlite/geodeploy.db`) — that file is a shared bind mount across api + celery containers.
- Dispatched from `routers/data/vector.py`, `routers/data/raster.py`, and `routers/data/discover.py` (CSV) via `.delay(...)`.

## Current status & known issues
- **Raster pixels keep their source CRS** (e.g. UTM 31N); TiTiler reprojects at tile time via the TileMatrixSet. **The stored bbox IS now reprojected to EPSG:4326** (`services/cog_converter.py::inspect()`, 2026-06-01) so `raster_layers.bbox` is lon/lat like vector. Before this, the UTM bbox crashed portal `fitBounds` with "Invalid LngLat latitude", aborting the whole portal init script (no layer switcher, no tiles). **Raster rows uploaded before the fix still hold UTM bbox — re-upload or backfill.**
- Vector reprojection is now set-based in PostGIS (`ST_Transform`) over a COPY-loaded staging table; the per-feature pyproj transform only runs as a fallback when the source CRS has no resolvable EPSG code.
- Status updates use raw sqlite3 with string-built `SET` clauses over a fixed set of internal keys — safe here but don't pass user input as column names.
- Errors set both job and layer `status='error'` with the message; the UI surfaces `error_message`.
- **`export.py` traps (all hit + fixed 2026-06-03; full detail in `notes_temp/notes_for_future.md`):**
  (1) the status endpoint calls the job ready when `{id}.zip` exists, but `zipfile.ZipFile(path,'w')`
  creates it empty immediately → poller downloaded an empty zip → **build to `.part` then `os.replace`**.
  (2) **GeoTIFF to a `BytesIO` is silently truncated** (GTiff needs a seekable dataset) → use
  `rasterio.io.MemoryFile`; also strip `tiled/blockxsize/blockysize/...` from the source profile.
  (3) **rasterio ≥1.4 forbids AWS creds in `rasterio.Env`** → pass them via
  `rasterio.session.AWSSession(endpoint_url=...)`, keep only `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT`/`AWS_HTTPS`/etc as Env kwargs.
- **Deploy:** the worker shares the api image — any task change needs
  `docker compose build geodeploy-api && up -d --force-recreate geodeploy-api celery` (recreating only
  api leaves celery running stale code → tasks fail as "unregistered" or run the old logic).
